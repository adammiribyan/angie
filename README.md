# Angie

So you wanna add a new directive, controller, service, template, whatever into the Angular land of your Rails app. You start digging down the rabbit hole to find the *right* place for each of them to be and it's kinda annoying. On top of it you might be as lazy as I am. So here's some tiny help with that.

## Available Generators

You can use any of the generators above, e.g. `rails g angie:model care_note`.

1. `angie:directive name`
2. `angie:model name`
3. `angie:resource name`
