So you wanna add a new directive, controller, service, template, whatever into the Angular land of your Rails app. You start digging down the rabbit hole to find the *right* place for each of them to be and it's kinda annoying. On top of it you might be as lazy as I am. So here's some tiny help with that.

## Available Generators
